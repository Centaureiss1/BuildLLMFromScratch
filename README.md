# BuildLLMFromScratch
## Introduction:
This project is a practical note based on Raschka, S. (2024). Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch). Simon and Schuster, along with its open source sample code (project link: https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch). The majority of the code in this repository comes from the original repository, but during my learning process I have added additional comments and modifications. The complete commit history is maintained to showcase the learning process. This project demonstrates how to build a large language model from scratch, covering core techniques such as model architecture, Transformer blocks, layer normalization, shortcut connections, and text generation.

## Citation:
Most of the code in this repository is derived from the original open source project. I would like to thank the original author and contributors.
